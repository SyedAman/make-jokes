# Jokes

A simple node application made using **VANILLA** Node.js. Sometimes we are so
dependent on 3rd party libraries, that we look past the core Node.js API. I
believe if we have a fundamental understanding of how Node works, then we can
create great products. At the very least, we should learn Node.js to choose the
right 3rd party libraries ;) What's beautiful about Node is you can do very
advanced things without any 3rd party libraries.
